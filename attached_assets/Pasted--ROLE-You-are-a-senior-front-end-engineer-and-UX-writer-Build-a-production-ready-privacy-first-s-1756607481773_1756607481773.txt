[ROLE]
You are a senior front-end engineer and UX writer. Build a production-ready, privacy-first single-page web app called “PrivateShare Lite”. It removes image metadata (especially GPS) entirely in the browser. No servers, no uploads, no telemetry. Ship as a static site.

[OBJECTIVE]
Implement this flow: Drop/choose images → auto-clean EXIF/IPTC/XMP (GPS, device/camera, creation time, software, embedded preview, etc.) → auto-download cleaned files.
• Single file: download immediately.
• Multiple files: download a ZIP automatically.
Everything must execute locally in the browser.

[SCOPE v1]
Supported input: JPEG/JPG, PNG, WebP.
Default removal targets:
  - GPS: latitude/longitude/altitude/timestamps (and related XMP/IPTC fields)
  - DateTimeOriginal/Created/Modified
  - Camera/Device model & serial, Software
  - XMP/IPTC blocks, embedded previews/thumbnails
ICC profile: default REMOVE to stay lightweight; expose a hidden “Advanced” panel to optionally KEEP ICC for color-critical users.
HEIC/AVIF: if the browser can decode locally, allow a one-click local convert → JPEG; if not possible, show a friendly unsupported message. Never upload.

[UX REQUIREMENTS]
Above-the-fold:
  - Large dropzone with copy:
      Heading: “Drop images to clean (No upload)”
      Subtext: “We remove GPS & metadata instantly — all in your browser.”
  - Secondary “Choose files” button for keyboard/mobile users.
On drop:
  - Immediately start processing; show progress: “Cleaning x / y”.
On completion:
  - Auto-download output (single or ZIP).
  - Show a large success check + “All clean. Safe to share.”
Keep the UI ultra-minimal. Options live behind a small “Advanced ▸” disclosure:
  - [ ] Keep ICC profile
  - [ ] Force output to JPEG (tooltip: may increase size for PNG/WebP)
  - [ ] JPEG/WebP quality slider (default 0.85)
Tiny link “What gets removed?” → tooltip/modal listing examples (GPS, device/camera, creation time, XMP/IPTC).
Accessibility: full keyboard navigation, clear focus states, sufficient contrast, aria-live for progress.
Internationalization: default EN; include a simple language toggle (EN/KO/ES/JA) via JSON messages; persist selection in localStorage.

[NON-FUNCTIONAL / PRIVACY]
100% client-side. No network calls for processing. No telemetry or analytics by default.
Show this privacy copy prominently:
  “All processing happens in your browser. We never upload your files.”
Disclaimers:
  “We remove standard metadata (EXIF/IPTC/XMP/GPS), but cannot guarantee removal of every vendor-specific tag. For highly sensitive files, verify before sharing.”
  “Image content itself may reveal information (e.g., signs/locations) independent of metadata.”

[TECH CHOICES]
Framework: React + Vite + TypeScript (SPA).
Image cleaning: decode → re-encode (Canvas/OffscreenCanvas) to strip metadata; PNG/WebP re-encode to drop text/meta chunks.
ZIP batching: JSZip (lazy-loaded after first drop).
Workers: use a Web Worker for heavy processing; process in small batches (e.g., 5–10 files) to keep UI responsive.
Auto-download: programmatic <a download>.
Error handling: unsupported/corrupted files show per-file warnings; continue with the rest.
PWA (optional): Service Worker for offline use (can be added later).

[PERFORMANCE]
Keep initial bundle small (inline SVG icons, system fonts). Lazy-load heavy deps (e.g., JSZip).
Handle ~10 images of ~10MB each on a mid-range laptop without UI freezing (use Worker + batching).

[SEO / COPY]
Title/H1: “Remove GPS & Metadata from Photos — No Upload (Drop → Clean → Download)”
Description: “Strip EXIF/IPTC/XMP & GPS entirely in your browser. Instant, private, free.”
Minimal FAQ in page + JSON-LD FAQ schema:
  Q: Do you upload my files? A: No, all processing is local.
  Q: What’s removed? A: GPS, device/camera, timestamps, XMP/IPTC, previews.
  Q: Which formats? A: JPEG/JPG, PNG, WebP (HEIC/AVIF if browser supports local decode).

[AD SLOTS (PLACEHOLDERS)]
Provide non-intrusive containers (fixed height to avoid CLS):
  - Top banner (e.g., 280px height)
  - Bottom banner on the completion screen
Do NOT include any ad scripts; just mark the containers clearly.

[UI TEXT (EN baseline)]
Hero heading: “Drop images to clean (No upload)”
Hero subtext: “We remove GPS & metadata instantly — all in your browser.”
Primary state messages:
  - Idle: “Drop images here or choose files”
  - Progress: “Cleaning {current}/{total}…”
  - Done single: “Done. Safe to share.”
  - Done multiple: “All clean. Safe to share.”
Links:
  - “Advanced ▸”
  - “What gets removed?”

[NAMING / OUTPUT]
Single file: {basename}_clean{ext}
ZIP file: privateshare_clean_{YYYYMMDD_HHMM}.zip

[TEST CASES]
1) 10 iPhone/Android JPEGs with GPS → ZIP auto-download; all images open; metadata stripped.
2) Mixed PNG screenshots → fast processing; {basename}_clean.png names.
3) Mixed WebP → either preserve WebP or force JPEG via Advanced; verify size/quality behavior.
4) HEIC/AVIF → show local convert if possible; otherwise friendly unsupported notice.
5) Keyboard-only flow: focus dropzone → Enter to choose files → process → auto-download.

[OUTPUT / STRUCTURE]
- index.html
- src/main.tsx, src/App.tsx, src/styles.css
- src/i18n/{en,ko,es,ja}.json
- src/utils/image.ts (decode/re-encode/clean)
- src/utils/zip.ts (lazy-load)

[DEFINITION OF DONE]
- “Drop → auto-clean → auto-download” works for single/multiple images with no server calls.
- Default removes GPS and common metadata; Advanced panel is hidden by default but functional.
- Clear privacy copy visible; minimal UI; accessible and keyboard-friendly.
- EN default with language toggle; basic SEO meta + JSON-LD FAQ.
- Build outputs a static bundle ready for Netlify.
